//HellO!

//Thank you for taking the time to visit this project! At this point, this is a completed project, highlighting
my skills in html and CSS. The aim was to create something cute, fun, but also show a sense of design.

//Mainly I worked to implement flexbox and grid combined. Although certain flexbox properties just didnt work properly for this type of design as most of the styling was centered rather than any other layout method. 

//Keypoints Of The Project

    -I did not want things to be hard to read or colors to contrast negatively. This is something I worked hard on to make readable.

    -I wanted to avoid super bright colors and keep things minimalistic to work on my professionalism of the project.

    -I wanted to learn something new from both grid and flexbox.

    -It was important to attempt a try at using flexbox and grid for several different items within a container to improve my idea and placements on things.

Overall contribution:

I feel good about this project. While simple, it is complete.
